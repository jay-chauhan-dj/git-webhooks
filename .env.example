######################################
# Project: My First Project

PROJECT_MY_FIRST_PROJECT_SLACK_WEBHOOK=https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXX/YYY/ZZZ

######################################

# 1. Naming Convention:
#    - PROJECT_<PROJECT_NAME>_<ATTRIBUTE>
#      Use this format to define environment variables for each project.
#    - Replace <PROJECT_NAME> with a unique identifier for your project (e.g., MY_FIRST_PROJECT).
#    - Replace <ATTRIBUTE> with one of the following:
#      - DEPLOY_SCRIPT: Path to the deployment script.
#      - SLACK_WEBHOOK: URL for sending Slack notifications.
#      - SECRET: Secret key for validating Git webhook requests.

# 2. Multiple Projects:
#    - Add configurations for additional projects by following the same structure.
#    - Ensure each project has unique environment variables.

# 3. Security:
#    - NEVER share your .env file with anyone or commit it to version control.
#    - Use this .env.example file as a reference for your actual .env file.

# 4. Deployment:
#    - Ensure all paths to deployment scripts are valid and the scripts have the necessary permissions.
#    - Verify Slack Webhook URLs are configured correctly in your Slack app.
